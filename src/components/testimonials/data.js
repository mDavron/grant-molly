      'Akrom has worked for us on and off for almost a year. He was a huge asset for us. Highly talented, super responsible, and goes above and beyond. He has worked remotely for us and not once did we have to look over his shoulder to make sure he was doing a good job. We would hire him full-time in a second, but all of our software engineers are Indonesia-based. Highly recommended!',

      'I have had the pleasure of working with Akramjon for close to 9 months on the frontend development of our products. Above all I was pretty impressed by the unique ideas he brought to the table which made me go "Ahhaaa thats cool way to do it" when reviewing his code and his constant drive to learn new stuff was noteworthy. He would be a great asset to any company for his skills in frontend development',
